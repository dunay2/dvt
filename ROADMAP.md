**Why this order?** IDs + naming policies (Glossary) → event envelope fields (RunEventCatalog) → type definitions → engine core (IWorkflowEngine + Temporal Interpreter) → adapter implementations + outbox → contract test fixtures (Golden Paths) → CI validation. Security docs are parallel (design, not blocking implementation).

### Deliverables

- ⏳ **Glossary**: Canonical definitions for IDs, terminology, and naming policies (issue #8)
- ⏳ **Event Catalog**: Complete event taxonomy with state machine validation (issue #9)
- ⏳ **TypeScript Types**: Interfaces for normative contracts (EngineRunRef, ArtifactRef, ProjectorInput, StateStoreAdapter) (issue #2)
- ⏳ **IWorkflowEngine + SnapshotProjector**: Core engine orchestration and event sourcing (issue #14)
- ⏳ **Temporal Interpreter Workflow**: DAG walker and activity dispatch (issue #15)
- ⏳ **TemporalAdapter**: Integration with Temporal.io for distributed execution (issue #5)
- ⏳ **PostgresStateStoreAdapter**: Postgres implementation with transactions, outbox storage, and projections (issue #6)
- ⏳ **Outbox Delivery Worker**: At-least-once event delivery (adapter-agnostic interface, Postgres polling in outbox-semantics.md) (issue #16)
- ⏳ **Golden Paths**: Executable example plans for contract testing (issue #10)
- ⏳ **CI Contract Testing Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for golden path validation (issue #17)
- ⏳ **Visual Documentation**: Sequence and state diagrams for critical flows (issue #3)
- ⏳ **Security Design**: Threat model, authorization contract, audit log schema for compliance (issue #19, design only)

### Success Criteria

**Compile & Type Safety**

- [ ] All types compile without errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Contract compile gate: `pnpm test:contracts` validates golden JSON fixtures against Zod/JSONSchema + versioned envelopes
- [ ] Zero TypeScript `any` types in contracts (strict mode)

**Golden Path Execution** (3 required plans)

- [ ] **Hello-world plan**: 3 steps linear → completes in < 30s
- [ ] **Pause/resume plan**: pause after step 1 → resume → completes → same final snapshot hash
- [ ] **Retry plan**: fail step 2 once → retry → completes → same snapshot hash as if step 2 succeeded first time

**StateStore Correctness**

- [ ] Projector rebuild: replay events from scratch → derived state hash matches live projection (idempotency proof)
- [ ] Outbox delivery: all events delivered at-least-once to EventBus (no lost events)
- [ ] Write latency p99 < 10ms (single-region, SSD, connection pool ≤50)

**CI & Documentation**

- [ ] CI passes (lint + type-check + unit tests + contract tests)
- [ ] Diagrams render correctly on GitHub
- [ ] Event catalog state machine validated against ExecutionSemantics (no illegal transitions)

### Risks

| CI pipeline brittleness        | Medium | #17 contract tests must be deterministic - validate against golden hashes                           |
| Dependency chain breakage      | Medium | Enforce critical path: #8 → #9 → #2 → #14 → #15 → #5,#6 → #16 → #10 → #17 (block PRs out of order)  |

## 🛡️ Phase 1.5: Hardening (Due: 2026-05-31)

**Objective**: Load testing, operational correctness validation, and security baseline before multi-adapter complexity.

### Focus Areas

**Load Testing** (tooling: [k6](https://k6.io/docs/))

- **Target**: 500 events/sec sustained (4K runs/hour @ 8 steps/run, 2 events/step average)
- **Metrics**: State write latency p99 < 10ms, projection delay p99 < 1s, zero dropped events
- **Chaos**: StateStore failover, network partition, worker crash (recovery < 30s)
- **Environment**: 4-core instance, 16GB RAM, SSD, connection pool configured per adapter
- **Adapter-specific details**: See individual adapter documentation (adapters/postgres/load-testing.md, etc.)

**Operational Correctness**

- **Idempotency torture**: 1M duplicate events (out-of-order, retries) → zero state corruption
- **Projector rebuild**: State projector replays 100K events → consistent snapshot (timing per adapter: see adapters/postgres/projector-rebuild.md)
- **Backpressure**: projection delay > 5s → trigger BACKPRESSURE_ON signal (no circuit breaker, consumer-driven)

**Security Baseline**

- **Authn/z**: API boundary enforcement (even if RBAC stubbed)
- **Audit trail**: 90-day hot, 7-year cold (automated archival policy + verification)
- **PII scrubbing**: regex scan → zero credentials in logs (automated gate in CI)

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Load test: 500 events/sec sustained for 4 hours → latency p99 < 10ms, projection p99 < 1s
- [ ] Chaos: StateStore failover during load → recovery < 30s, zero data loss
- [ ] Idempotency: 1M duplicate events → zero state corruption (hash compare)
- [ ] Projector rebuild: 100K events → consistent snapshot (timing per adapter documentation)
- [ ] Backpressure: projection delay > 5s → BACKPRESSURE_ON signal emitted (consumable by external systems)
- [ ] Security: penetration test passed, PII scan clean (zero credentials in logs)
- [ ] Operational readiness: 3 game-days completed → MTTR p50 < 5 min
- [ ] Adapter performance: Meet timing targets for chosen adapter (see adapters/\*/load-testing.md)

## 🚀 Phase 2: Advanced Tooling (Due: 2026-09-30)

**Objective**: Add development tools to ensure determinism and code quality. Start Conductor adapter development.

- ⏳ **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky hooks to run lint + tests before commit (issue #7)
- ⏳ **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow with mandatory checks (issue #7)
- ⏳ **Capability Versioning**: Governance policy for adding/deprecating capabilities (issue #11)
- ⏳ **SLOs**: Per-subsystem SLOs and error budget policy (issue #12)
- ⏳ **Conductor Adapter POC**: Cross-adapter determinism parity validation (Phase 2)

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Linting rules detect non-deterministic patterns
- [ ] Husky blocks commits that fail linting
- [ ] GitHub Actions PR checks include determinism linting
- [ ] Documentation of rules in CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Conductor adapter passes determinism parity test suite
- [ ] 10+ golden paths validated across Temporal and Conductor

## 🎯 Anchor Decisions

### Anchor Decision: Outbox Semantics (CORE - ADAPTER-AGNOSTIC)

**Decision Date**: 2026-02-11

**Core Principle**: Engine emits all external events via Outbox (no direct side effects). This is an **architectural invariant**, not an implementation detail.

**Delivery Model**: At-least-once (consumers must handle duplicates).

**Idempotency Key (Agnóstic)**:

```
idempotencyKey = tenantId + contractVersion + eventType + runId + stepId + attemptId
```

- **Consumer responsibility**: Deduplicate using idempotency key (e.g., upsert by key in consumer DB)
- **Replay safety**: Replaying events from outbox produces identical consumer state

**Backpressure Signal (Agnóstic)**:

- **Trigger condition**: Projection delay p99 > 5 seconds (or adapter-defined threshold)
- **Signal**: Engine emits `BACKPRESSURE_ON` (auditable, not circuit breaker)
- **Recovery**: When delay < 2 seconds, emit `BACKPRESSURE_OFF`
- **Consumer action**: Pause consuming OR reduce request rate (adapter-specific implementation)

**Consumer Contract**:

- Consumers receive events via EventBus (Kafka/RabbitMQ/etc. - adapter choice)
- **MUST** implement idempotent handling (upsert by idempotency_key)
- **MUST** tolerate duplicates, out-of-order delivery, and retries
- UI polling pattern: query StateStore latest-status index (not outbox directly)

**Outbox Storage Interface** (Abstract - Implemented by Adapter):

```typescript
// All outbox implementations must support:
interface IOutboxStorage {
  appendOutbox(event: OutboxEvent): Promise<void>;
  markDelivered(eventId: string): Promise<void>;
  pullUndelivered(limit: number): Promise<OutboxEvent[]>;
}
```

| Operation                | Guarantee                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `appendOutbox(event)`    | Transactional with state change (consistency) |
| `markDelivered(eventId)` | Idempotent (can safely retry)                 |
| `pullUndelivered(limit)` | Consistent read (no duplicates within batch)  |

**Adapter Responsibility**:

- **PostgreSQL adapter**: DDL, indices, polling frequency (100ms), batch size (100 events), locks, etc.
  - See: [adapters/postgres/outbox-semantics.md](adapters/postgres/outbox-semantics.md)
- **Other adapters** (future): Each defines storage, polling, delivery semantics **within the above constraints**

- [Transactional Outbox Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html)
- [engine-phases.md Anchor Decision B](docs/architecture/engine/roadmap/engine-phases.md) - StateStore retention
- Product Definition: "StateStore is primary truth, engine executes via outbox"
