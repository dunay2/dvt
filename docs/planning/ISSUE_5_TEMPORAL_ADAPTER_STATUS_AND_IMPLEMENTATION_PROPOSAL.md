# Issue #5 / #68 — Status, Achievements, and Temporal Implementation Proposal

<!--
Status: operational
Last-updated: 2026-02-21
Owner: dunay2

-->

**Date**: 2026-02-13  
**Branch**: `docs/issue-5-implementation-proposal`  
**Scope**: Execution documentation to unblock Temporal implementation on active `packages/*` paths

---

## 1) Current status and achieved points

### Achieved points (confirmed)

1. Active monorepo structure under `packages/*`.
2. Functional engine core with tests in `packages/engine`.
3. Centralized contracts in `packages/@dvt/contracts`.
4. `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal` package created (existing workspace base).

### Blocking gaps (Issue #5)

1. In `packages/@dvt/engine/src/adapters/temporal/TemporalAdapterStub.ts`, real execution is still `NotImplemented`.
2. `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/index.ts` is still a placeholder.
3. Full Temporal SDK wiring (Client + Worker + Workflow + Activities) does not yet exist on active paths.
4. Missing real adapter+engine Temporal integration test suite.
5. Drift exists between #5 and #68 (legacy scope vs current monorepo scope).

---

## 2) Non-negotiable principles

1. Separation of concerns: planner ≠ engine ≠ state ≠ UI.
2. Workflow determinism (no non-deterministic APIs in workflow code).
3. External effects in Activities (at-least-once ⇒ mandatory idempotency).
4. `RunStateStore` as the operational source of truth (do not rely on Temporal queries as the only truth).
5. Mandatory workflow versioning for replay-compatible evolution in live executions.

---

## 3) PR plan (execution order)

### PR-0 — Normalize tracking (#5 vs #68) + canonical paths

**Objective**

- Remove tracking drift.
- Keep one canonical issue for active Temporal implementation.

**Current status**

- 🟨 In progress (document and tracker text prepared).

**Done**

- Canonical operational text prepared for:
  - Closing #5 as superseded.
  - Updating #68 as canonical epic.
- Remaining action to close PR-0:
  - Publish tracker updates in #5 and #68 and mirror links/status back into this document.

### PR-1 — `adapter-temporal` foundation (Client + Config + Mapper contracts)

**Key files**

- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/config.ts`
- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/TemporalClient.ts`
- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/WorkflowMapper.ts`
- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/index.ts`

**Done**

- Client wrapper with `connect/close` lifecycle.
- Mapper with `workflowId = runId`, status mapping, and MVP task queue.

### PR-2 — `adapter-temporal` runnable MVP (WorkerHost + Workflow + Activities)

**Key files**

- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/TemporalWorkerHost.ts`
- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/workflows/RunPlanWorkflow.ts`
- `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/activities/StepActivity.ts`

**Done**

- Workflow running in a sandboxed/deterministic environment (no Node/DOM APIs in workflow code).
- Minimum evidence: workflow start + activity executed + completion event persisted + query/status returns store projection.

### PR-3 — Engine wiring (real adapter by default, stub for tests only)

**Objective**

- Remove the stub from the normal execution path.

### PR-4 — Idempotent Event Sink + RunState persistence contract (MVP)

**Objective**

- Cover at-least-once semantics without duplicates.

### PR-5 — Tests (unit + integration with Temporal environment)

**Objective**

- Stable CI harness.

**Recommended strategy**

- CI base: `TestWorkflowEnvironment.createTimeSkipping()`.
- Documented fallback: full local/server environment when CI requires it.

### PR-6 — CI + operational documentation

**Objective**

- Make it executable and maintainable by the team.

## 5) Global acceptance criteria (MVP)

1. `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/index.ts` is no longer a placeholder.
2. `packages/@dvt/engine/src/adapters/temporal/TemporalAdapterStub.ts` is removed from the normal production flow.
3. Minimum validated flow: `startRun -> signal/query/status -> cancel`.
4. Idempotency proven under activity retries.
5. Run state derived from persisted events.
6. Normalized tracking (#5/#68) with no scope ambiguity.
   - PR-0 is only considered completed after tracker publication is done (#5 closed as superseded and #68 updated as canonical epic).

---

## 6) Questions resolved

1. Resolved: #68 is canonical (epic) and #5 becomes superseded.
2. Resolved: CI first with embedded harness (`createTimeSkipping`), docker/local server as fallback.
3. Resolved with conditions: `in-memory` temporarily allowed for PR-4, but with equivalent idempotency semantics and clearly marked test/dev-only.

---

## 7) Operational text for PR-0 (tracking)

### 7.1 Closing comment for #5 (superseded)

```md
Closing #5 as **superseded** by #68.

Reason:

- The original scope of #5 includes references to legacy layout (`engine/...`) and previous naming.
- Real Temporal implementation must run and be tested on active paths **`packages/*`** (current monorepo).

New source of truth:

- **#68** becomes the canonical epic for Temporal Adapter (Client + Worker + Workflow + Activities + tests + CI).
- Status/plan document (branch): `docs/issue-5-implementation-proposal`.

Blocker solved by #68:

- Remove `TemporalAdapterStub` from normal flow.
- Add real Temporal SDK wiring in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal` + engine integration.
- Integration test suite (Temporal + engine) and idempotent semantics (at-least-once).
```

### 7.2 Suggested body for #68 (canonical epic)

```md
# #68 — Temporal Adapter (Epic, canonical)

**Scope**: Runnable Temporal Adapter implementation on active `packages/*` paths (monorepo).
**Status**: ACTIVE — Blocking for golden paths and deterministic multi-adapter validation.

## Non-negotiable principles

1. planner ≠ engine ≠ state ≠ UI
2. Workflow determinism
3. External effects in activities (idempotency)
4. RunStateStore as source of truth
5. Workflow versioning for replay/evolution

## 9) Implementation progress (2026-02-13)

### PR-0 tracking progress (current)

- Canonical tracking text is drafted in section 7 (`#5` superseded close comment + `#68` canonical epic body).
- Checklist status for PR-0 moved to in-progress.
- Exit condition for PR-0: publish issue updates and record resulting links/status in this document.

### PR-1 executed in code

- Config foundation implemented in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/config.ts`.
- Client wrapper lifecycle implemented in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/TemporalClient.ts`.
- Base mapper implemented in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/WorkflowMapper.ts`.
- Public exports enabled in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/index.ts`.

### Technical validation

- Package tests updated and green (`4 passed`) in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/test/smoke.test.ts`.
- Package TypeScript build green (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`).

### Scope note

This progress covers the PR-1 objective (foundation). Real workflow/activity execution (PR-2) remains the next step.

### Hardening applied after review

- The wrapper is no longer fake: it uses real Temporal connection with `Connection.connect` + `Client`.
- `single-flight` concurrency control was added for concurrent `connect()` calls.
- `close()` now closes real resources via `connection.close()`.
- `identity` remains optional to allow native SDK default behavior.

### PR-2 executed in code

- Activity factory implemented in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/activities/stepActivities.ts`.
  - `fetchPlan`: integrity validation + JSON parse + PlanRef metadata match.
  - `executeStep`: MVP step shape validation (stepId, kind only).
  - `emitEvent`: idempotent event emission to state store + outbox.
  - `saveRunMetadata`: run correlation persistence.
- Deterministic interpreter workflow in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/workflows/RunPlanWorkflow.ts`.
  - Signals: `pause`, `resume`, `cancel`.
  - Query: `status` (returns `WorkflowState`).
  - Logic: fetch plan → walk steps → emit lifecycle events.
  - Zero `Date.now`/`Math.random`/`process.env`/Node.js APIs.
- Worker lifecycle manager in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/TemporalWorkerHost.ts`.
  - `start(connection)` → creates Worker with bundled workflow + injected activities.
  - `shutdown()` → graceful drain.
- Local engine type surface in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/engine-types.ts` (structurally compatible with `@dvt/engine`).
- Public exports updated in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/src/index.ts`.
- New dependencies: `@temporalio/worker`, `@temporalio/workflow`, `@temporalio/activity`.

### PR-2 technical validation

- 15 tests passing (6 PR-1 foundation + 9 PR-2 activities).
- TypeScript build green (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`).
- tsconfig `paths` override applied to resolve `@dvt/contracts` via node_modules dist.
