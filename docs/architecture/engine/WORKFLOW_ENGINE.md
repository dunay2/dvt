## Appendix: Why This Partition?

### Problem with Monolithic Document

- ✗ 3,227 lines in single file → hard to review (PRs touch everything)
- ✗ Normative (MUST semantics) mixed with informative (how-tos, roadmap)
- ✗ Prose capabilities matrix → ambiguous, not executable
- ✗ Operator runbooks hidden in 3K lines → hard to find at 3am incident

### Solution: Modular Contracts

- ✅ Contracts <500 lines each → reviewable, versionable (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- ✅ Separated: normative (MUST, immutable) vs informative (evolve rápido)
- ✅ Capabilities as executable JSON schemas → code-gen ready
- ✅ Operators can find playbooks in dedicated docs

### Timeline

- **Feb 11**: Partition complete (this deprecation notice)
- **Feb 18**: All internal links migrated to new docs
- **Mar 11**: WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md removed
- **May 11**: External references expected to migrate (deprecation window: 90 days)

## How to Use This Guide

### If you have an old link to WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md

1. Find your section in the **"Where to Find Each Section"** table above
2. Click the new link
3. Update your bookmark / internal links

### If you're starting fresh

1. Go to [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) — central navigation hub
2. Choose your role (SDK dev, SRE, PM, etc.)
3. Follow the recommended path

### If you need the raw text

This file is kept for 90 days as a redirect. After May 11, 2026:

- Git history still contains full WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md (run `git log` to see it)
- Links to new documents are permanent
