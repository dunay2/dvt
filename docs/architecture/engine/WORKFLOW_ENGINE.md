## Appendix: Why This Partition?

### Problem with Monolithic Document
- âœ— 3,227 lines in single file â†’ hard to review (PRs touch everything)
- âœ— Normative (MUST semantics) mixed with informative (how-tos, roadmap)
- âœ— Prose capabilities matrix â†’ ambiguous, not executable
- âœ— Operator runbooks hidden in 3K lines â†’ hard to find at 3am incident

### Solution: Modular Contracts
- âœ… Contracts <500 lines each â†’ reviewable, versionable (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- âœ… Separated: normative (MUST, immutable) vs informative (evolve rÃ¡pido)
- âœ… Capabilities as executable JSON schemas â†’ code-gen ready
- âœ… Operators can find playbooks in dedicated docs

### Timeline
- **Feb 11**: Partition complete (this deprecation notice)
- **Feb 18**: All internal links migrated to new docs
- **Mar 11**: WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md removed
- **May 11**: External references expected to migrate (deprecation window: 90 days)

## How to Use This Guide

### If you have an old link to WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md
1. Find your section in the **"Where to Find Each Section"** table above
2. Click the new link
3. Update your bookmark / internal links

### If you're starting fresh
1. Go to [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) â€” central navigation hub
2. Choose your role (SDK dev, SRE, PM, etc.)
3. Follow the recommended path

### If you need the raw text
This file is kept for 90 days as a redirect. After May 11, 2026:
- Git history still contains full WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md (run `git log` to see it)
- Links to new documents are permanent
