## WHAT

- Added formal closure summaries used for the final close comments on issues #14 and #15.
- Preserved acceptance-criteria mapping and evidence traceability as markdown artifacts.

## FOR (goal)

Keep a durable, reviewable audit trail in-repo for the formal closure process already executed on GitHub issues #14 and #15.

## HOW

1. Added closure note for issue #14.
2. Added closure note for issue #15.
3. Included the PR markdown note previously used for issue #221 to keep `.gh-comments` consistent with executed operations.

## Scope

- `.gh-comments/issue-14-close-2026-02-19.md`
- `.gh-comments/issue-15-close-2026-02-19.md`
- `.gh-comments/pr-221.md`

## Risk / Rollback

- Risk: low (documentation-only changes).
- Rollback: revert commit `f88df63`.
