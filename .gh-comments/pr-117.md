## WHAT

- Aligned temporal adapter tests with glossary idempotency semantics.
- Removed `engineAttemptId` influence from test idempotency key fixture behavior.

## FOR (goal)

- Ensure tests reflect the normative rule: idempotency derives from `logicalAttemptId`, not `engineAttemptId`.

## HOW

1. Updated test idempotency key builder in `packages/@dvt/adapter-temporal/test/activities.test.ts`.
2. Updated assertion for retry-safe idempotency key value.
3. Replaced the test that expected variance by `engineAttemptId` with glossary-aligned expectation of stability.

## WHY

- Existing tests encoded contradictory semantics and could reintroduce drift against the glossary contract.

## Suitability

- Narrow, test-only correction with no production behavior changes.

## Blockers

- None.

## Opportunities

- Future follow-up can remove `engineAttemptId` from shared test fixture types where semantically unnecessary.

## Risk

- Low.

## Risks & Mitigation

- Risk: accidental runtime behavior changes.
- Mitigation: change scope limited to test file + targeted and broad validations.

## Impact

- Adapter-temporal test semantics are now consistent with glossary contract expectations.

## Validation evidence

- `pnpm --filter @dvt/adapter-temporal test` ✅
- `pnpm -r lint` ✅
- `pnpm -r build` ✅

Closes #117
