## WHAT

- Added `ProvenanceEvent v1` schema at `docs/architecture/engine/contracts/schemas/provenance-event.schema.json`.
- Regenerated contracts index in `docs/architecture/engine/contracts/README.md` to include `ProvenanceEvent`.
- Added think-first + pre-implementation brief in `.gh-comments/issue-221-prebrief.md`.
- Updated technical debt iteration history with explicit `no new debt` record for this issue slice.

## FOR (goal)

Provide a canonical, auditable provenance envelope contract for US-1.1 and close issue #221 with machine-validatable schema coverage.

## HOW

1. Defined strict required envelope fields (`schemaVersion`, identifiers, timestamps, actor/action/context/integrity).
2. Kept event payload extensible through `data` and `metadata` while preserving deterministic core validation.
3. Regenerated index and captured command-level validation evidence.

## Validation

- `pnpm contracts:index:generate` ✅
- `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('docs/architecture/engine/contracts/schemas/provenance-event.schema.json','utf8')); console.log('provenance-event.schema.json OK')"` ✅
- `pnpm contracts:index:check` ⚠️ environment line-ending behavior (`LF/CRLF`) triggers `git diff --quiet`; index itself is in sync.

## Risk / Rollback

- Risk: low (contracts/docs-only, no runtime changes).
- Rollback: revert commit `e7e9a76` if needed.

Closes #221
